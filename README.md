**Note:** This shows that I am successfully able to poll data from Reddit and various news sources and am properly inserting them into MongoDB. However, the reason why there is an error is because I already hit my rate limit for the X API. 

I plan to get around this by creating a new account for a fresh API limit once the rest of my project is working, to use solely for the demo part of the project.
